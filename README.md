# Nordstrom Rack
Nordstrom Rack offers branded clothing and accessories for women, men, and kids at a large discount to consumers across the United States and Canada. As of 2021, Nordstrom Rack operates 352 stores in 41 U.S. states and three Canadian provinces.

In this project I have cloned the Nordstrome Rack website and given some of the functionality as it is present in the original website.
